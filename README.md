All Code for UIC and related stuff

This repository will have all required code for any of the projects that I will be doing while at UIC. This repo will include
codes written in python.

Some insight into the codes within:

QE folder has code for manipulating Quantum Esspresso outputs and inputs
SIESTA folder has code for manipulating SIESTA outputs and inputs
The base folder contains code that is generic in nature.

More code will be added.
